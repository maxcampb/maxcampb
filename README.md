- 👋 Hi, I’m Max Campbell

- 👀 I’m interested in Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Coding in the Environmental, Social and Financial domains.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about bayesian regression and machine learning.

- 💞️ I enjoy working in teams on challenging applied mathematical and statistical problems. You can view some of my code [here](https://github.com/maxcampb/Code_showcase). Please reach out to me if I could be a good fit for your team - [here is my CV](https://github.com/maxcampb/maxcampb/blob/main/Max_Campbell_CV.pdf).
